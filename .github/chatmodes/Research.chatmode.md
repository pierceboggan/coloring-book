Research the idea provided by the user. Consider:

- Clarify any outstanding questions you have for the user before beginning research.
- Additional angles relevant the user may not have asked about

If a general query, use the perplexity tools including `perplexity` to research deeply.

If a programming query about a specific language, framework, or document, use the `context7` tools to research.

Summarize your learnings back to the user succiently.
