# AR Gallery Feature

## Overview
The AR Gallery feature brings your coloring pages to life by letting you view them in augmented reality! Place your artwork on walls, floors, and surfaces in the real world.

## How to Use

### Accessing AR Gallery
1. Open any completed coloring page from your Dashboard
2. Tap on the image to open the detail view
3. Tap the **"View in AR"** button in the management panel
4. Allow camera access if prompted

### Placing Your Artwork
1. Move your device around to help detect surfaces (walls, floors, tables)
2. Wait for the "Surface detected!" message
3. Tap anywhere on a detected surface to place your coloring page
4. The artwork will appear as a virtual poster in your space!

### Adjusting Your Artwork
- **Resize**: Pinch with two fingers to make the artwork bigger or smaller
- **Reposition**: Drag your finger across the screen while pointing at a new surface
- **Fine-tune size**: Use the +/- buttons at the bottom for precise adjustments
- **Reset**: Tap the reset button to remove all artwork and start fresh

### Capturing Your AR Scene
- Tap the camera button to take a screenshot of your AR gallery
- Screenshots are automatically saved to your Photos library

## Tips for Best Results

✨ **Lighting**: Use good lighting for better surface detection
🎯 **Movement**: Move your device slowly to help AR track surfaces
📐 **Surfaces**: Flat surfaces work best (walls, tables, floors)
🖼️ **Multiple Images**: Place multiple coloring pages to create a gallery wall!

## Technical Requirements

- iOS 16.0 or later
- ARKit-compatible device (iPhone 6s or newer, iPad Pro or newer)
- Physical device (AR features don't work in simulator)
- Camera permission
- Photo library permission (for screenshots)

## Troubleshooting

**"No surface detected" message?**
- Move your device around more to help AR scan the environment
- Ensure you have good lighting
- Try pointing at a flat surface like a wall or table

**Can't place the artwork?**
- Make sure you see the "Surface detected!" message first
- Tap directly on the detected surface
- Try a different surface or angle

**Image won't resize?**
- Make sure you've placed an image first
- Try using the +/- buttons instead of pinch gesture
- Reset and try placing again

## Privacy & Permissions

The AR Gallery feature requires camera access to:
- Detect surfaces in your environment
- Display your coloring pages overlaid on the real world

No video or photos are captured except when you explicitly tap the screenshot button. Your camera feed is processed entirely on your device and is never sent to any servers.
