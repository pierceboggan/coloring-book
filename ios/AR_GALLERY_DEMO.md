2. **Wait for the message**: "See? It detected the wall/floor!"
3. **Explain**: "The app uses ARKit to understand the 3D space around us"

2. **Tap camera button**: "Take a screenshot..."
3. **Show confirmation**: "Saved to Photos! Now I can share it."

### Key Points to Emphasize

✨ **"Real-time 3D"**: The artwork stays in place as you move around
🎯 **"Easy to use"**: Just tap, pinch, and drag - natural gestures
📱 **"Works anywhere"**: Place artwork on walls, floors, tables, anywhere!
📸 **"Shareable"**: Capture and share your AR gallery
🎨 **"Multiple images"**: Create a full gallery wall with many pieces

### Demo Tips

#### Lighting
- Use rooms with good lighting
- Avoid very dark spaces
- Indirect natural light works best

#### Surfaces
- Flat walls work great
- Tables and floors are perfect
- Avoid mirrors or very shiny surfaces
- Patterned surfaces detect better than plain white

#### Movement
- Move device slowly and smoothly
- Keep movements steady for best tracking
- Let AR "see" the surface from different angles

#### Positioning
- Start with medium-sized placement (30cm)
- Stand 1-2 meters from the wall
- Try different heights and arrangements

### Common Demo Questions & Answers

**Q: Does this work on all phones?**
A: Works on iPhone 6s and newer, all iPad Pros, and iPad 5th gen+

**Q: Do you need internet?**
A: Only to load the image initially. Once loaded, AR works offline.

**Q: Can you save the AR scene?**
A: You can take screenshots, but the 3D placement isn't saved (yet!)

**Q: How accurate is the placement?**
A: Very accurate! ARKit tracks with millimeter precision.

**Q: Can others see the art?**
A: No, it's only on your screen. But you can share screenshots!

**Q: Does it drain battery?**
A: AR uses more battery than normal, but it's optimized for efficiency.

## Screenshot Scenarios

### Recommended Screenshots to Take

1. **Hero shot**: Single artwork centered on a wall, medium size
2. **Gallery wall**: 3-4 images arranged in a grid pattern
3. **Large format**: Oversized artwork covering most of a wall
4. **Creative placement**: Images on floor, ceiling, or unusual angles
5. **Real-world context**: Include furniture or people for scale
6. **Before/after**: Original photo → coloring page → AR view

### Best Composition Tips

- Include some real-world elements for context
- Show the edge of the wall/surface to prove it's AR
- Use interesting angles (not just straight-on)
- Capture good lighting for vibrant colors
- Include multiple images when possible
- Show someone interacting with the AR for scale
